# resume_builder_ui

This the frontend for the adobe_resume_generator api which is created as a seperate project.\
All the frontend components are hosted and their links are provided in document of the backend api. But still if you want to test this locally you can do so.
**NOTE** In order to test this locally you need to have the latest version of flutter installed in your system. Follow the section below to get started with flutter in your system

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Testing

If the following command runs in your terminal and is not giving any errors then you can follow along.
```dart
flutter doctor
```

After cloning this repo just select you service and hit run. Thats it. This will automatically build the debug version of the project for that particular platform and you would be able to test the app locally
